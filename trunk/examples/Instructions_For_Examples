Here are some instructions to run knowledge demos.

1) Make sure binaries are in their proper folders or in a folder called "examples/bin/"
2) Drop all dlls (if you are on windows) on the binaries folder.
3) On nintendo wii, create a folder on your SD card root called knowledge, drop the entire examples folder content there.
