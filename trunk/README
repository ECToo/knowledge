Well, this isnt ready yet, but since mk2 pointed out, here are some 
stuff you need to know.

1- This isnt complete, so you take your own risks for using it.
2- You are going to need libpng, libjpeg, zlib, libfat, libogc and for the physics demo, libode for WII
3- The code is subject to API breakage.
4- Most of the stuff just work, if it doesnt tell me in romulo [at] castorgroup [dot] net
or abra185 |at| yahoo |.| com
5- Thanks for testing, i hope we all do a great job =]

To compile for wii just do make -f Makefile.wii
with the proper DEVKITPPC and DEVKITPRO environment variables 
set. 

== to build on MS Windows ==

I only prepared projects for codeblocks since it is small and free. You
should find all projects in knowledge_root/projects and it should be pretty easy to compile (hit build on cb). 
What i am worried are the dependencies, here are the ones i used:

pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release
FreeImage
SDL
ODE
GLEW

I compiled every one of them using codeblocks and it just worked. If you are having any problems, feel free to contact me.
Those dependencies are included now with knowledge latest code, check it out ;)

Sincerely,
Romulo Fernandes.
