============================
Knowledge, 0.1 release.
============================

Overview:
Knowledge is an engine i been creating in my spare time since August, 31 of 2008. The goal is to make a practical and fast engine where developers can feel comfortable and do things in a organized way. The engine features over 40.000 lines of C/C++/ASM code, its multi platform, contains abstraction to common objects (sprites, models, particles), hardware acceleration for 3D operations and dynamic data type loaders. The full source is organized and documented in both Doxygen and html manuals. Thanks for looking for knowledge and if possible, let me know about your bugs and general usage experience. 


=====================
Install Instructions
=====================

The engine isnt complete yet, so if you have some bugs, please let me know
on knowledge site -> http://code.google.com/p/knowledge

------------------------------------------
Instructions to compile knowledge on Wii:
------------------------------------------

- You are going to need libpng, libjpeg, zlib, libfat and libogc
- Enter knowledge directory and execute make -f Makefile.wii with the proper DEVKITPPC and DEVKITPRO environment variables set. 

------------------------------------------
Instructions to compile knowledge on Windows:
------------------------------------------

I only prepared projects for codeblocks since it is small and free. You should find a knowledge workspace in 
knowledge_root/projects/codeblocks_win32/ and you will just need to hit Build. Dependencies are already included.


------------------------------------------
Instructions to compile knowledge on GNU/Linux:
------------------------------------------

You just need to run ./autogen.sh and then ./configure && make on the knowledge root directory.
Knowledge will look for dependencies using pkgconfig so make sure you have it. The following dependencies are needed:

-FreeImage
-SDL
-ODE (for physics demo)
-Glew


Again, Thanks for using knowledge!

Sincerely,
RÃ´mulo Fernandes, knowledge creator.
