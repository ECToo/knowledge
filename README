Well, this isnt ready yet, but since mk2 pointed out, here are some 
stuff you need to know.

1- This isnt complete, so you take your own risks for using it.
2- You are going to need libpng, zlib, libfat, libogc and for the physics demo, libode for WII
3- The code is subject to API breakage.
4- Most of the stuff just work, if it doesnt tell me in romulo [at] castorgroup [dot] net
or abra185 |at| yahoo |dot| com
5- Thanks for testing, i hope we all do a great job =]

To compile for wii just do make -f Makefile.wii
with the proper DEVKITPPC and DEVKITPRO environment variables 
set. The pc version is known to work on GNU/Linux. I havent tested
it on windows yet, so your best choice is deal with it, c'mon, GNU/Linux is free.

Sincerely,
Romulo Fernandes.
